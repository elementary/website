        <p>If youâ€™re trying to download elementary OS, please head back to <a href="/">the home page</a> for the most up-to-date version. If you were brought here from a third-party website, it is possible they were attempting to bypass the payment prompt or installation directions. Please inform them that download links are temporary, per-user, and load-balanced. The correct way to link to the download is to link to <a href="https://elementary.io">elementary.io</a>.</p>
