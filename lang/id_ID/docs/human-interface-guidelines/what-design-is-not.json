    "<strong>Design is not something you add on after you've completed a product.</strong> Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing anything you build.

A folding bicycle has a different set of design goals than a mountain bicycle. Things like weight, size, and tire tread are important factors in helping the intended user reach their goals. Because we understand that design is about solving specific problems, we must also understand that we can objectively compare the effectiveness of two designs at solving those problems.": "<strong>Design is not just like your opinion, man.</strong> Design is quantifiable.
