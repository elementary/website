    "The purpose of this guide is to provide clean and accurate instructions on\nwriting good code across all elementary projects. This guideline is to be\nfollowed on every file, in order to keep our code consistent and readable. We\nare also inheriting some of the GNOME's Vala guidelines to keep our code\nconsistent with other Vala programs.": "Le but de ce guide est de proposer des instructions claires et précises\nconcernant l'écriture d'un code correct pour les projets d'elementary. Les conseils de ce guide doivent être appliqués à tous les fichiers, afin que la présentation soit uniforme et lisible. Certaines des règles sont hérités du guide du projet Vala de GNOME dans le but de garder nos projets homogènes avec ces derniers.",
    "If the guidelines here proposed are followed, newcomers to elementary\ndevelopment will be more easily able to join the development and\nunderstand code. Besides, it'll make it easier for all developers to work on\napplications that they don't usually work on, because the code will be\nconsistent. Finally, as Guido Van Rossum said - &quot;Code is much more often read\nthan written&quot;, so having nicely written code is crucial.": "Si les lignes directrices proposées ici sont suivies, il sera plus facile pour les nouveaux arrivants d'être en mesure de rejoindre le développement et de comprendre le code. En outre, il sera plus facile pour tous les développeurs de travailler sur des applications sur lesquelles ils ne travaillent pas d'ordinaire puisque le code sera plus cohérent. Enfin, comme l'a dit Guido Van Rossum - \"Le codes est beaucoup plus souvent lu qu'écrit.\", donc avoir un code bien écrit est crucial.",
