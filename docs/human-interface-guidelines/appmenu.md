# AppMenu {#appmenu}

The AppMenu is an optional menu which is opened using the gear-shaped icon on the far-right of an app's toolbar. It provides relevant menu items in place of the traditional "File, Edit, View..." menu bar.

## Usage {#usage}

You should first consider if your app needs this widget. While most apps may have one, your app may not necessarily need an AppMenu.

When adding items to your AppMenu, consider the following:

* Items should be relevant and useful. It's not acceptable to duplicate items that are found in your main UI here.
* If the app includes a "preferences" window, it should be available from the AppMenu.
* There should be an item for the "About" dialog which contains links to the project's bug tracker, help, etc.
* If an AppMenu is displayed, a menu bar should not be, and vice-versa.
