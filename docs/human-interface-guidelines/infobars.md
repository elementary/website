It is important to determine the severity or type of infobar to use. There are four types of infobars available:

* **Information**: Supplemental information and an optional action the user may perform. Shows as white in the UI.
* **Question**: A non-critical question for the user. An answer of some sort is expected, but it's not urgent or severe. Shows as blue in the UI.
* **Warning**: Lets the user know something unexpected or bad may happen and provides an action to resolve it. Displays as yellow in the UI.
* **Error**: Informs the user of an error that has occured and requires a user action to resolve it. Reserved for critical situations. Displays as red in the UI.
