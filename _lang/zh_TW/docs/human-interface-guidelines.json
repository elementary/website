    "Human Interface Guidelines": "人機介面指南",
    "These guidelines are designed to help developers and designers create a beautifully consistent experience on the elementary OS desktop. They were written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be working on elementary OS. They will not only define specific design elements and principles, but will also instill a philosophy that will help you decide when it is appropriate to deviate from the Guidelines. Adhering to the suggestions contained here will provide many benefits:": "",
    "Users will learn to use your application faster because it shares common elements that they are already familiar with.": "使用者會覺得你的程式很好上手，因為你的程式擁有他們熟悉的共通元素。",
    "Users will accomplish tasks more quickly because you will have a straight-forward interface design that isn't confusing or difficult.": "使用者的工作效率會提昇，因為你的程式介面直觀明瞭，不會令人感到困惑。",
    "Your application will appear native to the desktop and share the same elegant look as default applications.": "你的程式會和預設程式一樣擁有典雅的外觀，與桌面環境完美融合。",
    "Your application will be easier to document because an expected behavior does not require explanation.": "為你的程式撰寫使用文件會變得更簡單，因為使用者可預期的行為毋需解釋。",
    "The amount of support you will have to provide, including bugs filed, will be lessened (for the reasons above).": "同樣的道理，你必須提供的後續支援（包含處理使用者回報的臭蟲）將會減少。",
    "To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop. The most important thing to remember is that following these guidelines will make it easier to design a new application, not harder.": "本文內容涵蓋基本的介面元素、如何有效運用這些元素、如何讓你的程式和桌面環境完美整合。最重要的是，遵守這些本文的建議是為了讓設計新程式變得更簡單，而不是更難。",
    "However, keep in mind that this is a guideline, not a rulebook. New, amazing interaction paradigms appear every day and more are waiting to be discovered. This is a living document that can and will be changed.": "切記：本文是設計方針，不是規則手冊；內容是活的，不是死的，隨時都可以修改。這世界每天都會產生令人讚嘆的新互動模式，等著我們去探索發現。",

    "Design Philosophy": "設計哲學",
    "The elementary OS HIG isn't just about a set of concrete rules; it's meant to be flexible and extensible. As such, this very first portion of the guideline is all about the guiding philosophy we employ. For a quick crash course, we like \"The User is Drunk\":": "",
    "What Design Is Not": "設計不是…",
    "Before we get into all the things that make up elementary OS apps, there is a clarification that needs to be made. We need to understand what exactly design is about, but more importantly we want to smash two major myths:": "",
    "<strong>Design is not something you add on after you've completed a product.<\/strong> Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing anything you build. It is an intrinsic part of creating something. Design is not just what something looks like. It's not just the colors and fonts. Design is how it works. When you decide to add a button that does a thing, that is design. You made a decision to add a button with an icon or a label and where that button went and the size and color of that button. Decisions are designs.": "<strong>所謂設計，並非產品完成後才加上去的東西。<\/strong>不管你有沒有意識到這點，製作任何產品的過程中，你時時刻刻都在設計。設計是創造的一部分；設計決定的不只是產品的外觀風格或字體色彩，而是整個產品的運作方式。你決定要新增一個按鈕，你決定給按鈕搭配圖示或文字標籤，你決定按鈕的作用、尺寸和顏色……你做的每一個決定都是設計。",
    "<strong>Design is not just, like, your opinion, man.<\/strong> Design is testable. One design will meet a specific goal better than another design. Consider different types of bicycles. A folding bicycle has a different set of design goals than a mountain bicycle. Things like weight, size, and tire tread are important factors in helping the intended user reach their goals. Because we understand that design is about solving specific problems, we must also understand that we can objectively compare the effectiveness of two designs at solving those problems.": "<strong>設計不是就你的喜好而已，老兄。<\/strong>好的設計禁得起考驗；好的設計會比其他設計更符合某個特定的目標。以腳踏車為例，折疊車和越野車有著截然不同的設計目標。車子的重量、尺寸、胎紋都是重要因素，決定一輛車能不能滿足目標客戶的需求。既然我們知道設計是在解決特定的問題，我們就該明白，我們可以客觀比較兩種設計解決相同問題的效力。",
    "Design Is Not Veneer, Aral Balkan": "Aral Balkan：「設計不是表面工夫。」",
    "Design is Not Subjective, Jeff Law": "Jeff Law：「設計不是主觀的。」",
    "Concision": "簡潔",
    "Always work to make your app instantly understandable. The main function of your app should be immediately apparent. You can do this in a number of ways, but one of the best ways is by sticking to a principal of concision.": "",
    "Avoid Feature Bloat": "避免功能爆多",
    "It's often very tempting to continue adding more and more features into your application. However, it is important to recognize that every new feature has a price. Specifically, every time you add a new feature:": "不斷增加新功能是很誘人的事，但你應該知道，每個新功能都有其代價。具體來說，每當你新增功能時……",
    "Your application gets slower, consumes more resources, and takes up more disk space.": "你的應用程式越跑越慢，佔用越來越多資源，吃越來越多磁碟空間。",
    "Your application's interface becomes more cluttered and thus harder to use.": "你的程式介面變得越來越凌亂，因而更難使用。",
    "More time is spent implementing this new feature, rather than perfecting an old feature.": "你花費更多時間在導入新功能，而不是完善舊功能。",
    "More code can often mean a greater possibility for bugs.": "程式碼越多，生出臭蟲的可能性通常也會越高。",
    "More features means more work on documentation, translations, etc.": "功能越多，代表撰寫文件或翻譯的工作量越大。",
    "Think in Modules": "模組化思考",
    "Build small, modular apps that communicate well. elementary OS apps avoid feature overlap and make their functions available to other apps either through <a href=\"#contractor\">Contractor<\/a> or over <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Software\/dbus\" title=\"View D-Bus docs from FreeDesktop.Org\">D-Bus<\/a>. This both saves you time as a developer (by other apps making their functions available to you), and is a courteous gesture towards other developers (by making your app's functions available to them).": "",
    "Avoid Configuration": "避免組態設定",
    "If possible, completely avoid presenting any settings or configuration in your app. Providing settings is usually an easy way out of making design decisions about an app's behavior. But just like with problems of feature bloat, settings mean more code, more bugs, more testing, more documentation, and more complexity.": "",
    "Build for the \"Out of The Box\" Experience": "",
    "Design with sane defaults in mind. elementary OS apps put strong emphasis on the out of the box experience. If your app has to be configured before a user is comfortable using it, they may not take the time to configure it at all and simply use another app instead.": "",
    "Ask the Operating System": "問作業系統",
    "Get as much information automatically as possible. Instead of asking a user for their name or their location, ask the system for this information. This cuts down on the amount of things a user has to do and makes your app look intelligent and integrated.": "",
    "Do You Really Need It?": "你真的需要嗎？",
    "Ask yourself if the configuration option you are adding is really necessary or makes sense to a user. Don't ever ask users to make engineering or design decisions.": "問自己這個組態選項真的有那麼必要嗎？對用戶而言合理嗎？別叫用戶為應用程式的工程或設計參數作決定。",
    "When You Absolutely Have To": "當你真的得這麼做",
    "Keep things contextual. Instead of tucking away preferences in a configuration dialog, think about displaying them in context with the objects they affect (much like how shuffle and repeat options appear near your music library).": "",
    "If your app needs to be configured before it can be used (like a mail client), present this configuration inside the main window much like a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Welcome Screen<\/a>. Once again, make sure this is really necessary set-up. Adding unnecessary configuration screens stops users from doing what they wanted to do when they opened your app in the first place.": "",

    "Use Understandable Copy": "",
    "Avoid technical jargon and assume little-to-no technical knowledge. This lets your app be \"self-documenting.\"": "",

    "User Workflow": "使用者操作流程",
    "Visible design is a large part of the user experience, but so is the user's workflow, or how they interact with an app. In this section, we cover a few important steps of a typical workflow:": "",
    "<strong>First-Launch Experience<\/strong>: What the user sees the first time they use your app.": "",
    "<strong>Normal Launch<\/strong>: What happens when opening your app on a day-to-day basis.": "",
    "<strong>Closing<\/strong>: What happens when closing your app.": "",
    "<strong>Background Tasks<\/strong>: How your app manages to do things invisibly in the background.": "",
    "First-Launch Experience": "首次執行體驗",
    "Required Configuration": "需要的組態",
    "When a user first launches an app, they should be able to get down to business as quickly as possible. If configuration is not absolutely required for the first use, they should not be required to configure anything. If configuration is required, they should be presented with a clean and simple <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen<\/a> within the app. Avoid separate configuration dialogs when launching.": "",
    "Speed of Launch": "執行速度",
    "Your app's first launch is the user's first impression of your app; it's a chance to really show off its design and speed. If your app has to configure things in the background before visibly launching, it gives the user the impression that the app is slow or will take a long time to start up. Instead, focus on making the application window appear fast and ready to be used, then do any background tasks behind the scenes. If the background task is blocking (ie. the user is unable to perform certain tasks until it's complete), show some type of indication that a background process is happening and make the blocked user interface items insensitive (see: <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Widget Concepts<\/a>).": "",
    "Welcoming the User": "歡迎使用者",
    "If there is no content to show the user, provide actions they can act upon by using a simple <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen<\/a>. Let them open a document, add an account, import a CD, or whatever makes sense in the context of the app.": "",
    "Resetting the App": "重置此 App",
    "If a user explicitly \"resets\" the app (ex. by deleting all songs in a music library or removing all mail accounts in a mail client), it should return to its first-launch state.": "",
    "Normal Launch": "簡單啟動",
    "When a user launches an app, they're performing an explicit action and expecting a fast, oftentimes immediate response. You should focus on three key areas for app launching: speed, obviousness of what to do next, and state.": "",
    "Speed": "速度",
    "As has been said before, speed, especially when launching an app, is very important. There should be as little delay as possible in between the time a user decides to launch an app and the instant they can begin using it. If your app requires a splash screen, you're doing it wrong.": "",
    "Obviousness": "顯而易見性",
    "When a user launches your app, they should know exactly what to do next. This is achieved by following the other interface guidelines (ensuring your app is consistent with other apps) and by offering up explicit actions from the get go. If the app typically displays \"items,\" such as songs or emails, let the user get at those items by displaying them when the app opens. If there are no previously-opened items, you should offer to open or create a new item (such as a document) by using a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen<\/a>.": "",
    "State": "狀態",
    "If the user has previously used your app, it's typically best to restore the state of the app when opening it again. This means the app comes up to right where the user left off so they can pick up their work again. For a music player, this means opening up with the view where the user left it and the song paused where the user closed the app. For a document editor, this would mean opening up with the same document scrolled to the same spot with the cursor in the same spot on the page.": "",
    "Always Provide an Undo": "",
    "Sometimes a user will perform an action which could possibly be destructive or traditionally irreversible. Rather than present the user with a warning, apps should let the user undo the action for an appropriate amount of time. Some prime examples of when this behavior is useful are:": "",
    "<strong>Closing an app<\/strong>. Rather than warning the user, automatically save their work and the app's state so they can return exactly where they left off. See <a href=\"#closing\">Closing<\/a>.": "",
    "<strong>Deleting an item<\/strong>. Instead of asking the user if they are sure, make the item \"disappear\" from the app, but provide an easy and intuitive way to undo the delete.": "",
    "<strong>Sending an email<\/strong>. Rather than asking the user if they want to send an email, let them undo or edit the message a short time after \"sending.\"": "",
    "<strong>Editing a photo<\/strong>. Instead of asking the user if they want to destructively apply an edit, let them undo the edit and always keep the original backed up.": "",
    "This behavior should only as a last resort be implemented by providing a buffer time between when the app shows the user what happened and actually performing the action. To keep the experience responsive, the app should always look as if it performed the action as soon as the user initiates it. ": "This behavior should only as a last resort be implemented by providing a buffer time between when the app shows the user what happened and actually performing the action. To keep the experience responsive, the app should always look as if it performed the action as soon as the user initiates it.",
    "This behavior strikes the best balance of keeping out of the user's way while making sure they don't do something unintended. It's important to keep the undo action unobtrusive yet simple and intuitive; a common way of doing so is by using an info bar, though other methods may also be appropriate.": "",

    "Always Saved": "總是儲存",
    "Users should feel confident when using elementary; they should know that everything they see is saved and up to date.": "",
    "Apps in elementary should operate around an always-saved state. This means that changes the user makes are instantly applied and visible and that making the user manually save things is a legacy or specialized behavior.": "",
    "For example, a Song Info dialog should update the track information instantly without a user having to press a save button, user preferences should be applied as soon as the user manipulates the relevant widget, and closing an app should mean that reopening it will return to where the user left off.": "",
    "Closing": "關閉",
    "When a user closes an app, it's typically because they're done using it for now and they want to get it out of the way.": "",
    "Saving State": "儲存狀態",
    "Apps should save their current state when closed so they can be reopened right to where the user left off. Ideally closing and reopening an app should be indistinguishable from the traditional concept of minimizing and unminimizing an app; that is, all elements should be saved including open documents, scroll position, undo history, etc.": "",
    "Background Tasks": "背景任務",
    "If it makes sense for an app to complete background tasks after the window is closed, the tasks should be completed soon after the window is closed. If the app performs repeat background tasks (such as a mail client), the background tasks should be handled by a separate daemon that does not rely on the app itself being open.": "",
    "Closing the App Window": "關閉 App 視窗",
    "It is not desirable for an app window to simply minimize rather than close when the user attempts to close it. Instead, the app window should be \"hidden\". If it makes sense to continue a process in the background (such as downloading\/transferring, playing music, or executing a terminal command) the app backend should continue with the task and close when the task is finished. If it's not immediately apparent that the process has completed (as with the file download\/transfer or terminal command), the app may show a notification informing the user that the process has completed. If it is apparent, as with the music, no notification is necessary.": "",
    "Re-Opening the App Window": "重新開啟 App 視窗",
    "If the user re-opens the app while the background process is still executing, the app should be exactly where it would be if the window had been open the whole time. For example, the terminal should show any terminal output, the music player should be on the same page it was when closed, and the browser should come back to the page it was on previously.

    "Desktop Integration": "桌面整合",
    "An important advantage that developers have when choosing the elementary OS platform is the ability to seamlessly integrate their application with the default desktop. Outlined below are the several ways in which you can make your application feel beyond native in elementary. This section will cover things like:": "",
    "<strong>Creating an App Launcher<\/strong>. The primary method of discovering and using your app will be through an app launcher found in Slingshot or in the dock. This section details how to create these launchers.": "",
    "<strong>MIME handling<\/strong>. If your application can open and save files, place entries for those file types in the application database and the document type (MIME) database.

    "Preference dialogs should be made Transient, but not Modal. When a user makes a change in a preference dialog, the change should be immediately visible in the UI. If the dialog is modal, the user may be blocked from seeing (and especially from interacting with) the change. This means they will have to close the dialog, evaluate the change, then possibly re-open the dialog. By making the dialog transient, we keep the dialog on top for easy access, but we also let the user evaluate and possibly revert the change without having to close and re-open the preference dialog.": "",

    "Controls That Do Nothing": "",
    "A very common mistake for developers to make is creating controls that seemingly do nothing. Keep in mind that we want to present an environment where users feel comfortable exploring. A curious user will interact with a control expecting there to be some immediate reaction. When a control seemingly does nothing, this creates confusion and can be scary (Think,  \"uh-oh I don't know what happened!\"). In some cases, controls that do nothing are simply clutter and add unnecessary complexity to your UI.": "",
    "Consider the \"clear\" button present in <a href=\"#search-fields\">search fields<\/a>. This button only appears when it is relevant and needed. Clicking this button when the field is already clear essentially does nothing. ": "",
    "Sensitivity": "",
    "Sometimes it doesn't make sense for a user to interact with a widget until some pre-requisite is fulfilled. For example, It doesn't make sense to let a user click a browser's \"Forward\" button unless there is forward history available. In this case, you should make the \"Forward\" button insensitive or a user may click it, expecting a result, and be confused when nothing happens.": "",
    "It's usually better to make a widget insensitive than to hide it altogether. Making a widget insensitive informs the user that the functionality is available, but only after a certain condition is met. Hiding the widget gives the impression that the functionality is not available at all or can leave a user wondering why a feature has suddenly \"disappeared\".": "",
    "Hidden Widgets": "",
    "When a widget only makes sense in a certain context (not as an indicator of an action to be performed) sometimes it does make more sense to hide it. Take hardware requirements for example: It may not make sense to show multi-display options if the system only has a single display. Making multi-display options insensitive is not really a helpful hint on this system. Another exemption to this rule is a widget that a user will only look for in context, like the clear button example above. Finally, Keep in mind that insensitive items will still be recognized by screen readers and other assistive tech, while hidden widgets will not.": "",

Usually this means that the user should expect a new interface element to appear such as a new window, dialog, toolbar, etc in which they must enter more information or make a selection before completing the intended action. This is an important distinction because a user should typically expect an instant action from buttons and menu items while this prepares them for an alternate behavior.

Consider that the absence of an ellipsis implies the app will handle the action immediately. This means that the app will automatically generate a report or customize its own toolbar. Using an ellipsis makes the important distinction that the user will be writing the report or selecting which toolbar items to show.": "",
    "<strong>Warns the user of a potentially dangerous action.<\/strong> For example, Log Out, Restart, and Shut Down all use ellipses because they display an alert that asks the user to confirm or cancel a potentially harmful action.
