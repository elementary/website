    "Localizing our website and apps is a very important part of making elementary OS available to as many people as possible. Instead of relying solely on an internal translation team, we use crowdsourcing so that anyone can submit translations with little to no technical knowledge. In order to keep our voice consistent across the entire platform, and to help new translators get started, we’ve put together this translation guide.": "Lokalizovanje našeg web sajta i aplikacija predstavlja vrlo bitan dio našeg cilja da učinimo elementary OS dostupan što je većem broju ljudi moguće. Umjesto da zavisimo isključivo na našem internom timu za prevode, koristimo crowdsourcing tako da svako može da doda nove prevode bez obzira na nivo tehničkog predznanja. Da bismo objasnili proces prevođenja čitave naše platforme, kreirali smo ovaj vodič za prevođenje da bismo pomogli novim prevodiocima da se uključe u proces.",
