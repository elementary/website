Or, to create your own custom image: install the OS, configure any necessary packages or settings using a temporary administrator account, delete the account, and then create an image of the disk. In both cases, Initial Setup will create an end user account upon the customer's first boot.": "",

    "Plugs": "",
    "System Settings (codenamed <a href=\"https://github.com/elementary/switchboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Switchboard</a>) uses a concept of “Plugs” to provide pluggable settings for various hardware and software concerns.

    "Switchboard": "",
    "OEMs can develop and ship custom plugs if special or unique hardware in the machine requires configuration in addition to what is available by default in elementary OS; for example, special sensors or input methods not present in most hardware.

In addition to software information (like the OS version), it also provides a space for hardware information. By default, this is filled in with a generic image and the system’s hostname. However, OEMs can provide custom branded data for this section.": "",
    "Switchboard About": "",

    "Third-Party Repositories": "",
    "It is highly discouraged to ship elementary OS with software repositories other than the defaults in elementary OS plus a single repository provided and controlled by the OEM. <strong>Third-party repos effectively give root access and the ability to overwrite any system packages to potentially untrusted third parties.</strong> Even if the party is trustworthy, an OEM’s customer’s security and privacy are now at stake if third parties are compromised, or they reuse their password on multiple services, etc.": "",
    "Further, if a third-party repository ever becomes unmaintained or unpublished, <strong>it may prevent regular OS updates.</strong> This could hold back potentially serious security and stability fixes from reaching the OEM’s customers.": "",
