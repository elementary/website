    "Getting Started": "はじめに",
    "Welcome to the elementary Developer Guide! This book was created to teach you all about creating and distributing apps for elementary OS. The introduction will make sure that you have all the tools for the job and a solid understanding of what this book is about. Some of you may feel confident enough to jump straight into coding. If that's the case, you might want to skip ahead and start writing your first app.": "elementary デベロッパーガイドへようこそ! このガイドでは、 elementary OS 向けのアプリを開発し、配布するためのすべてが説明されています。まずは、アプリを開発するために必要なツールを確かめ、このガイドの目的をはっきりさせていきます。もし早くコーディングを始めたいなら、そしてそれをできる自信があるなら、このセクションは読み飛ばしてもかまいません。",
    "However, we strongly recommend to at least skim through this preparation step. Having the right setup is going to help you reach your goals faster, and having a solid foundation is going to help you throughout the rest of this book.": "ですが、このセクションには目を通しておくことをおすすめします。完全なセットアップは、目標への到達をより早くでき、この後のガイドを読んでいく上でも役に立つでしょう。",
    "What We Will And Won't Cover": "ガイドが取り扱う範囲",
    "We're going to assume that you have absolutely no experience in writing apps for elementary. But we will assume some basic programming knowledge, and hopefully a little experience in Vala or at least similarly syntaxed languages. If you're not familiar with Vala, we highly encourage you to brush up on it before coming here.": "このドキュメントは、初めてアプリを作る人向けに書かれています。しかし、基本的なプログラミングの知識があり、少しなりとも Vala に触れた経験があることを前提とする部分が一部ありますので、このガイドを読む前に Vala を学習しておくとスムーズです。",
    "We’re also not covering design too much in this guide; that’s what the <a href=\"\/docs\/human-interface-guidelines\">Human Interface Guidelines<\/a> (HIG) are for, and you’re highly encouraged to take a look there before beginning your app. We're going to assume you have a basic knowledge of (or at least a quick link to) the HIG and focus on coding. However, elementary is all about great design and stellar consistency. It’s important you grasp these concepts before moving on.": "このガイドでは、デザインに関しては最小限しか取り扱っていません。アプリを作成する前に、 <a href=\"\/docs\/human-interface-guidelines\">ヒューマンインターフェイスガイドライン<\/a> (HIG) をよく読んで理解してください。これからのガイドは、 HIG について基本的な知識をお持ちである (最低限、いつでも参照できる) ものとして進めていきます。\nelementary はそのデザインが大きな特徴です。開発を始める前に、そのコンセプトをしっかりと理解してください。",
    "In this book, we're going to talk about building apps using GTK+, Granite, and other tech available in elementary, setting up a build system, hosting your code for collaborative development, working with translations, a few other bits and pieces, and finally packaging and distributing your new app.": "このガイドでは、 GTK+ や Granite などの elementary で使用可能なテクノロジーについて、ビルド環境のセットアップについて、複数人での開発について、アプリの多国語化について、パッケージ化と配布について、を主に扱います。",
    "The Basic Setup": "セットアップ",
    "Before we even think about writing code, you'll need a certain basic setup. This chapter will walk you through the process of getting set up. We will cover the following topics:": "アプリを作りはじめる前に、いくつかの準備が必要です。ここでは、プログラミングを始める前にしなければならない以下の点について触れます。",
    "Creating an account on GitHub and importing an SSH key": "",
    "Setting up the Git revision control system": "",
    "Getting and using the elementary developer &quot;SDK&quot;": "",
    "We’re going to assume that you’re working from a clean installation of elementary OS Loki or later. This is important as the instructions you’re given may reference apps that are not present (or even available) in other Linux based operating systems like Ubuntu. It is possible to apply the principles of this guide to Ubuntu development, but it may be more difficult to follow along.": "",
    "GitHub": "",
    "GitHub is an online platform for hosting code, reporting issues, tracking milestones, making releases, and more. If you're planning to publish your app through AppCenter, you'll need a GitHub account. If you already have an account, feel free to move on to the next section. Otherwise, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/join\">sign up for a GitHub account<\/a> and return when you're finished.": "",
    "Git": "",
    "To download and upload to GitHub, you'll need the Terminal program <code>git<\/code>. Git is a type of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revision_control\">revision control system<\/a> that allows multiple developers to collaboratively develop and maintain code while keeping track of each revision along the way.": "",
    "If you're ready, let's get you set up to use Git:": "",
    "Open the Terminal and install Git": "",
    "We need to inform Git who we are so that when we upload code it is attributed correctly. Inform Git of your identity with the following commands": "",
    "To authenticate and transfer code securely, you’ll need to generate an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Secure_Shell\">SSH<\/a> key pair (a kind of fingerprint for your computer) and import your public key to GitHub. Type the following in Terminal:": "",
    "When prompted, press <kbd>Enter<\/kbd> to accept the default file name for your key. You can choose to protect your key with a password or press <kbd>Enter<\/kbd> again to use no password when pushing code.": "",
    "Now we're going to import your public key to GitHub. View your public SSH key with the following command, then copy the text that appears": "",
    "Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/settings\/keys\">your SSH keys page<\/a> and click the green button in the upper right-hand corner that says &quot;New SSH key&quot;. Paste your key in the &quot;Key&quot; box and give it a title.": "",
    "We're all done! Now you can download source code hosted on GitHub and upload your own code. We'll revisit using <code>git<\/code> in a bit, but for now you're set up. For a more in-depth intro to Git, we recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/learn\/learn-git\">Codecademy's course on Git<\/a>.": "",
    "Developer &quot;SDK&quot;": "",
    "At the time of this writing, elementary OS doesn't have a full SDK like Android or iOS. But luckily, we only need a couple simple apps to get started writing code.": "",
    "Scratch": "",
    "The first piece of our simple &quot;SDK&quot; is the code editor Scratch. This comes by default with elementary OS. It comes with some helpful features like syntax highlighting, auto-save, and the Folder Manager extension. There are other extensions for Scratch as well, like the Outline, Terminal or Devhelp extensions. Play around with what works best for you.": "",
    "Terminal": "ターミナル",
    "We’re going to use Terminal in order to compile our code, push revisions to GitHub (using <code>git<\/code>), and other good stuff. Throughout this guide, we’ll be issuing Terminal commands. You should assume that any command is executed from the directory “Projects” in your home folder unless otherwise stated. Since elementary doesn’t come with that folder by default, you’ll need to create it.": "",
    "Open Terminal and issue the following command:": "ターミナルを開いて、次のコマンドを発行してください:",
    "Development Libraries": "開発ライブラリ",
    "In order to build apps you're going to need their development libraries. We can fetch a basic set of libraries and other development tools with the following terminal command:": "アプリをビルドするためには、アプリの開発ライブラリが必要です。次のターミナルコマンドでライブラリの基本セットをと開発ツールを取得できます。",
    "And with that, we're ready to dive into development! Let's move on!": "さて、これで開発の準備は整いました! 次へ進みましょう。",
    "Hello World": "",
    "The first app we’ll create will be a basic and generic “Hello World”. We’ll walk through the steps of creating folders to store our source code, compiling our first app, and pushing the project to a Git branch. Let’s begin.": "",
    "Setting Up": "セットアップ",
    "Apps on elementary OS are organized into standardized directories contained in your project's &quot;root&quot; folder. Let's create a couple of these to get started:": "",
    "Create your root folder called &quot;gtk-hello&quot;": "",
    "Create a folder inside that one called &quot;src&quot;. This folder will contain all of our source code.": "",
    "Later on, We'll talk about adding other directories like &quot;po&quot; and &quot;data&quot;. For now, this is all we need.": "",
    "Gtk.Window and Gtk.Button": "Gtk.Window と Gtk.Button",
    "Now what you've been waiting for! We're going to create a window that contains a button. When pressed, the button will display the text &quot;Hello World!&quot; To do this, we're going to use a widget toolkit called GTK+ and the programming language Vala. Before we begin, we highly recommend that you do not copy and paste. Typing each section manually will help you to practice and remember. Let's get started:": "",
    "Create a new file in Scratch and save it as &quot;gtk-hello.vala&quot; inside your &quot;src&quot; folder": "",
    "First we must create the main function of our new GTK app. Type the following in your &quot;gtk-hello.vala&quot;.": "",
    "Now, that we've initialized Gtk, we'll create a new window and declare a few properties of this window. You'll notice that most of these property names are pretty straightforward. Try to guess what each one does and we'll explain in a second. Type the following after the <code>Gtk.init<\/code> line, but before the last bracket:": "今、私たちは Gtk を初期化したので、新しいウィンドウを作成し、このウィンドウのいくつかのプロパティを宣言します。これらのプロパティ名のほとんどは非常に簡単であることに気がつくでしょう。それぞれが何をするかを推測してみてください、私たちは次に説明します。<code>Gtk.init<\/code> 行の次、最後の括弧の前に、次のように入力してください:",
    "The first line creates a new <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> called &quot;window&quot;. The second line sets the window title that you see at the top of the window. Next, we create a margin inside that window so that widgets don't bump up against the window's edge. Then we tell the window manager that we want to place this window in the center of the screen instead of in the default position (which is usually the top left). We also must give our window a default size so that is does not appear too small for the user to interact with it. Finally, we explain what to do with this process if the main window is closed; In our case, we want to quit.": "",
    "Now that we've defined a nice window, let's put a button inside of it. After our window stuff (but before <code>Gtk.main<\/code> line), leave a new line and then type the following:": "今、私たちは素敵なウィンドウを定義したので、その中にボタンを配置してみましょう。私たちのウィンドウのものの後 (ただし<code>Gtk.main<\/code>の行の前) に、新しい行を残し、その後、次のように入力します:",
    "Any ideas about what happened here? We've created a new <code>Gtk.Button<\/code> with the label &quot;Click me!&quot;. Then we've said that if this button is clicked, we want to change the label to say &quot;Hello World!&quot; instead. We've also said that we want to make the button insensitive; We do this because clicking the button again has no visible effect. Finally, we add the button to our <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> and declare that we want to show all of the window's contents.": "",
    "Compiling and Running your code": "コンパイルとコードの実行",
    "Ready to test it out? Fire up your terminal and make sure you're in &quot;~\/Projects\/gtk-hello\/src&quot;. Then execute the following commands to compile and run your first Gtk app:": "",
    "Did it work? If so, congratulations! If not, read over your source code again and look for errors. Also check the output of your terminal. Usually there is helpful output that will help you track down your mistake.": "動作しましたか？もしそうなら、おめでとうございます！そうではない場合、もう一度あなたのソースコードを読み返してエラーを探してください。またターミナルの出力を確認してください。たいてい、ミスの追跡を手助けする、役立つ出力があります。",
    "Pushing to GitHub": "",
    "After we do anything significant, we must remember to push our code. This is especially important in collaborative development where not pushing your code soon enough can lead to unintentional forks and pushing too much code at once can make it hard to track down any bugs introduced by your code.": "",
    "First we need to create a new repository on GitHub. Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/new\">the new repository page<\/a> and create a new repository for your code.": "",
    "Open Terminal and make sure you're in your project's root directory &quot;~Projects\/gtk-hello&quot;, then issue the following commands": "",
    "Remember to replace <code>yourusername<\/code> with your GitHub username and <code>yourrepositoryname<\/code> with the name of the new repository you created.": "",
    "With these commands, we've told <code>git<\/code> to track revisions in this folder, that we'd like to track revisions on the file &quot;gtk-hello.vala&quot; specifically, we've committed our first revision and explained what we did in the revision, and then we've told <code>git<\/code> to push your code to GitHub.": "",
    "Victory!": "おめでとう！",
    "Let's recap what we've learned to do in this first section:": "この最初のセクションで学んだことを復習しましょう:",
    "We created a new project containing a &quot;src&quot; folder": "",
    "We created our main vala file and inside it we created a new <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> and <code>Gtk.Button<\/code>": "メインの vala ファイルを作成し、その中に新しい <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> と　<code>Gtk.Button<\/code> を作成しました。",
    "We built and ran our app to make sure that everything worked properly": "すべてが正常に動くことを確認するために、アプリをビルドして実行しました。",
    "Finally, we commited our first revision and pushed code to GitHub": "",
    "Feel free to play around with this example. Make the window a different size, set different margins, make the button say other things. When you're comfortable with what you've learned, go on to the next section.": "この例で気軽に遊んでみてください。ウィンドウを異なるサイズにしたり、異なる余白を設定したり、ボタンに何か別のことを言わせてみてください。学んだことに慣れたら、次のセクションに進んでください。",
    "A Note About Libraries": "ライブラリに関する注意",
    "Remember how when we compiled our code, we used the <code>valac<\/code> command and the argument <code>--pkg gtk+-3.0<\/code>? What we did there was make use of a &quot;library&quot;. If you're not familiar with the idea of libraries, a library is a collection of methods that your program can use. So this argument tells <code>valac<\/code> to include the GTK+ library (version 3.0) when compiling our app.": "",
    "In our code, we've used the <code>Gtk<\/code> &quot;Namespace&quot; to declare that we want to use methods from GTK+ (specifically, <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> and <code>Gtk.Button.with_label<\/code>). Notice that there is a hierarchy at play. If you want to explore that hierarchy in more detail, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/valadoc.org\/gtk+-3.0\/Gtk.Button\">check out Valadoc<\/a>.": "",
    "Our First App": "初めてのアプリケーションを作る",
    "In the previous chapter, we created a simple &quot;Hello World!&quot; app to show off our vala and Gtk skills. But what if we wanted to share our new app with a friend? They'd have to know which packages to include with the <code>valac<\/code> command we used to build our app, and after they'd built it they'd have to run it from the build directory like we did. Clearly, we need to do some more stuff to make our app fit for people to use, to make it a <em>real<\/em> app.": "",
    "Hello (again) World!": "",
    "To create our first real app, we're going to need all the old stuff that we used in the last example. But don't just copy and paste! Let's take this time to practice our skills and see if we can recreate the last example from memory. Additionally, now that you have the basics, we're going to get a little more complex and a little more organized:": "これから初めての本物のアプリケーションを作りますが、例に漏れず、私たちも前章の例を再び持ち出してくる必要があります。でもちょっと待って、コピーアンドペーストはやめましょう！今はスキル向上のために私たちが先ほど作った例を、記憶だけを頼りにもう一度作ってみる練習をしてみましょう。さて、あなたはすでに基本を学んでいます。せっかくなので、もう少し複雑で組織化されたものを作ってみましょう:",
    "Create a new folder in &quot;~\/Projects&quot; called &quot;hello-world&quot; and put our last project in that folder. Now create a new folder inside &quot;~\/Projects\/hello-world&quot; called &quot;hello-again&quot;. We're doing this because our first &quot;gtk-hello&quot; and &quot;hello-again&quot; are two branches of the same &quot;hello-world&quot; project. As you get more into collaborative development, you're going to have lots of branches. This method will help you stay organized.": "",
    "Now go into &quot;hello-again&quot; and create our directory structure including the &quot;src&quot; folder.": "",
    "Create &quot;hello-again.vala&quot; in the &quot;src&quot; folder.  This time we're going to prefix our file with a small legal header. More about legal stuff later. For now you can copy <a href=\"https:\/\/elementary.io\/docs\/code\/reference#gpl-header\">the GPL header from our reference documentation<\/a>. Be sure to assign the copyright to yourself at the top of the header and change the author to you at the bottom of the header.": "",
    "Now, let's create our main function, a <code>Gtk.Window<\/code>, and set the window's default properties. Refer back to the last chapter if you need a refresher.": "それでは、main 関数を作り、 <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> でデフォルトプロパティを設定しましょう。もし必要であれば、前章に戻ってください。",
    "For the sake of time let's just put a <code>Gtk.Label<\/code> instead of a <code>Gtk.Button<\/code>. We don't need to try to make the label do anything when you click it.": "今回は時間の都合で、<code>Gtk.Button<\/code> の代わりに  <code>Gtk.Label<\/code> を使うことにします。ラベルをクリックした際、何か動作をするように仕込む必要はありません。",
    "Don't forget to add it to your window and show the window's contents:": "そして、これをウィンドウの中身に追加するのを忘れないでくださいね。",
    "Build &quot;hello-again.vala&quot; just to make sure it all works. If something goes wrong here, feel free to refer back to the last chapter and remember to check your terminal output for any hints.": "",
    "Initialize the branch, add your files to the project, and write a commit message using what you learned in the last chapter. Lastly, make sure you've created a new repository for your project on GitHub push your first revision with <code>git<\/code>:": "",
    "Everything working as expected? Good. Now, let's get our app ready for other people to use.": "すべてうまくいきましたか？ OK、ではこのアプリを他の人が使えるようにしましょう。",
    "The .desktop File": ".desktop ファイル",
    "Every app comes with a .desktop file. This file contains all the information needed to display your app in the Applications menu and in the Dock. Let's go ahead and make one:": "すべてのアプリには .desktop ファイルが付属しています。このファイルには、アプリケーションメニューとドックにアプリを表示するために必要となるすべての情報が含まれています。ここでひとつ作ってみましょう:",
    "In your project's root, create a new folder called &quot;data&quot;.": "",
    "Create a new file in scratch and save it in the &quot;data&quot; folder as &quot;com.github.yourusername.yourrepositoryname.desktop&quot;. This naming scheme is called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reverse_domain_name_notation\">Reverse Domain Name Notation<\/a> and will ensure that your .desktop file has a unique file name.": "",
    "Type the following into your .desktop file. Like before, try to guess what each line does.": "",
    "The first line declares that this file is a &quot;Desktop Entry&quot; file. The next three lines are descriptions of our app: The branded name of our app, a generic name for our app, and a comment that describes our app's function. Next, we categorize our app. Then, we say what command will execute it. Finally, we give our app an icon (a generic one included in elementary OS) and let the OS know that this isn't a command line app. For more info about crafting .desktop files, check out <a href=\"\/docs\/human-interface-guidelines\/app-launchers\">this HIG entry<\/a>.": "",
    "Finally, let's add this file to <code>git<\/code> and commit a revision:": "",
    "AppData.xml": "",
    "Every app also comes with an .appdata.xml file. This file contains all the information needed to list your app in AppCenter.": "",
    "In your data folder, create a new file called &quot;com.github.yourusername.yourrepositoryname.appdata.xml&quot;. Just like with the .desktop file, we use RDNN to avoid file naming collisions.": "",
    "Type the following into your .appdata.xml file": "",
    "These are all the mandatory fields for displaying your app in AppCenter. There are plenty of other optional fields that you can read about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/software\/appstream\/docs\/chap-Metadata.html\">here<\/a>.": "",
    "There are also some special custom fields for AppCenter to further brand your listing. Specifically, you can set a background color and a text color for your app's header and banner. You can do so by adding the following keys inside the <code>component<\/code> tag:": "",
    "You can specificy colors here in either Hexidecimal or RGB. The background color will automatically be given a slight gradient in your app's banner.": "",
    "You can also specify a suggested price in whole USD. Remember though that AppCenter is a pay-what-you-want store. This is not a price floor. Users will still be able to choose any price they like, including 0.": "",
    "Legal Stuff": "法律に関するもの",
    "Since we're going to be putting our app out into the wild, we should include some information about who wrote it and the legal usage of its source code. For this we need two new files in our project's root folder: AUTHORS and COPYING.": "私たちがしようとしているのは、このアプリを野に解き放つことです。そこで、アプリは誰が作ったのか、ソースコードの法的な取り扱い方はどうなるのかを示しておくべきでしょう。これをするためには、プロジェクトのルートフォルダに AUTHORS と COPYING の2つのファイルを追加します。",
    "Authors": "",
    "The AUTHORS file is pretty straightforward. This file contains your name and email address along with the name and email address of anyone who helped you make your app. It typically looks like this:": "AUTHORS ファイルは非常に簡単です。このファイルには、アプリを開発するのに携わった人すべての名前とＥメールアドレスを、あなたのものも含め記載します。例えば、こんな感じになります。",
    "Copying": "",
    "The COPYING file contains a copy of the license that your code is released under. For elementary apps this is typically the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/quick-guide-gplv3.html\">GNU General Public License<\/a> (GPL). Remember the header we added to our source code? That header reminds people that your app is licensed and it belongs to you. You can choose other licenses like the MIT license as well, but for this example let's stick to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/gpl-3.0.txt\">GPL<\/a>.": "COPYING ファイルはコードが採用しているライセンスのコピーになります。elementary のアプリでは、通常 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/quick-guide-gplv3.html\">GNU General Public License<\/a> (GPL) を使います。ソースコードに追加したヘッダーを覚えていますか？あれはアプリがライセンスされていること、そしてあなたが作ったものであることを証明するものなのです。もちろん、MIT ライセンスなどの他のライセンスを選ぶこともできますが、ここでは <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/gpl-3.0.txt\">GPL<\/a> を使いましょう。",
    "Mark Your Progress": "進捗のマーク",
    "Did you remember to add these files to <code>git<\/code> and commit a revision? Each time we add a new file or make a significant change it's a good idea to commit a new revision and push to GitHub. Keep in mind that this acts as a backup system as well; when we push our work to GitHub, we know it's safe and we can always revert to a known good revision if we mess up later.": "",
    "Now that we've got all these swanky files laying around, we need a way to tell the computer what to do with them. Ready for the next chapter? Let's do this!": "これで必要なファイルは揃いました。次に私たちはこのファイルで何をするかをコンピュータに伝えてやらないといけません。準備はいいですか？次に進みましょう！",
    "The Build System": "ビルドシステム",
    "The next thing we need is a build system. The build system that we're going to be using is called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmake.org\">CMake<\/a>. We already installed the <code>cmake<\/code> program at the beginning of this book when we got the build dependencies for Granite Demo. What we're going to do in this step is create the files that tell Cmake how to install your program. This includes all the rules for building your source code as well as correctly installing your .desktop file and the binary app that results from the build process.": "次に必要なのはビルドシステムです。ここで私たちが使うのは <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmake.org\">CMake<\/a> と呼ばれているものです。このガイドの最初ですでに <code>cmake<\/code> は Granite Demo の依存関係としてインストールしてあります。ここで行うのは、 Cmake がどのようにプログラムをインストールするのかを伝えるファイルを作ることです。このファイルでは、ソースコードをビルドし、 .desktop ファイルとビルドの結果できたバイナリをインストールするルールを記述します。",
    "Create a new file in your project's root folder called &quot;CMakeLists.txt&quot;. Since this file is a bit long, we've included some comments along the way to explain each section. You don't have to copy those, but type the rest into that file:": "",
    "And you're done! Your app now has a real build system. Don't forget to add these files to <code>git<\/code> and push to GitHub. This is a major milestone in your app's development!": "",

In fact, we built your app in a separate folder like this so that we can easily delete or ignore the &quot;build&quot; folder and it won't mess up our app's source code.": "",
    "We'll revisit CMake again later to add some more complicated behavior, but for now this is all you need to know to give your app a proper build system. If you want to explore CMake a little more on your own, you can always check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmake.org\/cmake\/help\/documentation.html\">CMake's documentation<\/a>.": "私たちはさらに複雑なことをするために再度 CMake を使うことになりますが、アプリにあったビルドシステムを作るために知っておくことは今のところもうありません。もし CMake について詳しく知りたい方は、<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmake.org\/cmake\/help\/documentation.html\">CMake のドキュメント<\/a> もご覧ください。",

Change the names of files and see if you can still build and install them properly. Ask another developer to clone your repo from GitHub and see if it builds and installs cleanly on their computer. If so, you've just distributed your first app! When you're ready, we'll move onto the next section: Packaging.": "",
    "Adding Translations": "翻訳を追加する",
    "Now that you've learned about CMake, the next step is to make your app able to be translated to different languages. The first thing you need to know is how to convert strings in your code into translatable strings. Here's an example:": "CMake が使えるようになったら、次はアプリを他の言語でも使えるようにすることです。まずはじめに、プログラムの中に出てくる文字列を、翻訳ができる形式に書き換えてやる方法をお教えします。次の例を見てください。",

    "Creating Layouts": "レイアウトを作成する",
    "Now that you know how to code, build, and package an app using Vala, Gtk, CMake, and Debian packaging, it’s time to learn a little bit more about how to build out your app into something really useful. The first thing we need to learn is how to lay out widgets in our window. But we have a fundamental problem: We can only add one widget (one “child”) to <code>Gtk.Window<\/code>. So how do we get around that to create complex layouts in a Window? We have to add a widget that can contain multiple children. One of those widgets is <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>.": "",
    "Widgets as Subclasses of Other Widgets": "他のウィジェットのサブクラスとしてのウィジェット",
    "Before we get into <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>, let’s stop for a second and take some time to understand Gtk a little better. At the lower level, Gtk has classes that define some pretty abstract traits of widgets such as <a href=\"https:\/\/valadoc.org\/gtk+-3.0\/Gtk.Container\"><code>Gtk.Container<\/code><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/valadoc.org\/gtk+-3.0\/Gtk.Orientable\"><code>Gtk.Orientable<\/code><\/a>. These aren’t widgets that we’re going to use directly in our code, but they’re used as building blocks to create the widgets that we do use. It’s important that we understand this, because it means that when we understand how to add children to a <code>Gtk.Container<\/code> like <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>, we also understand how to add children to a <code>Gtk.Container<\/code> like <code>Gtk.Toolbar<\/code>. Both Grid and Toolbar are widgets that are subclasses of the more abstract class <code>Gtk.Container<\/code>.": "",
    "If you want to understand more about these widgets and the parts of Gtk that they subclass, jump over to <a href=\"https:\/\/valadoc.org\/\">Valadoc<\/a> and search for a widget like <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>. See that big tree at the top of the page? It shows you every component of Gtk that <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code> subclasses and even what those components subclass. Having a lower level knowledge of Gtk will help you to implement widgets you haven’t worked with before since you will understand how their parent classes work.": "",
    "Gtk.Grid": "",
    "Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s get back to our Window and <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>. Since you’re a master developer now, you can probably set up a new project complete with CMake, push it to GitHub, and set up Debian Packaging in your sleep. If you want the practice, go ahead and do all of that again. Otherwise, it’s probably convenient for our testing purposes to just play around locally and build from Terminal. So code up a nice <code>Gtk.Window<\/code> without anything in it and make sure that builds. Ready? Let’s add a Grid.": "",
    "Just like when we add a Button or Label, we need to create our <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>. As always, don’t copy and paste! Practice makes perfect. We create a new Gtk.Grid like this:": "ボタンやラベルを追加するときのように、<code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>を作成する必要があります。いつものように、コピー＆ペーストしないでください！練習は完璧にします。このように新しい Gtk.Grid を作成します。",
    "Remember that Button and Label accepted an argument (a String) in the creation method (that’s the stuff in parentheses and quotes). As shown above, <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code> doesn’t accept any arguments in the creation method. However, you can still change the grid’s properties (like <a href=\"https:\/\/valadoc.org\/gtk+-3.0\/Gtk.Orientation\">orientation<\/a>) as we did on the second line. Here, we’ve declared that when we add widgets to our grid, they should stack vertically.": "",
    "Let’s add some stuff to the Grid:": "グリッドにいくつかのものを追加しましょう。",
    "Super easy stuff, right? We can add the grid to our window using the same method that we just used to add widgets to our grid:": "とても簡単、ですよね？ グリッドにウィジェットを追加するのと同じ方法を使用して、グリッドをウィンドウに追加することができます。",
    "Now build your app and see what it looks like. Since we’ve given our grid a <code>Gtk.Orientation<\/code> of <code>VERTICAL<\/code> the labels stack up on top of each other. Try creating a <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code> without giving it an orientation. By default, <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>’s orientation is horizontal. You really only ever have to give it an orientation if you need it to be vertical.": "アプリをビルドし、それがどのように見えるかを確認してください。グリッドの<code>Gtk.Orientation<\/code>に<code>VERTICAL<\/code>を与えているので、ラベルはそれぞれの上部に積み重なります。向きを与えずに<code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>を作成してみてください。デフォルトでは、<code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>の向きは水平です。もしあなたがそれを垂直にする必要があるならば、あなたは本当にそれに向きを与えなければなりません。",
    "Functionality in Gtk.Grid": "Gtk.Grid の機能",
    "Okay, so you know all about using a <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code> to pack multiple children into a Window. What about using it to lay out some functionality in our app? Let’s try building an app that shows a message when we click a button. Remember in our first “Hello World” how we changed the label of the button with <code>button.clicked.connect<\/code>? Let’s use that method again, but instead of just changing the label of the button, we’re going to use it to change an empty label to a message.": "さて、あなたは<code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>を使って複数の子を1つのウィンドウにまとめることについて知っています。アプリにいくつかの機能をレイアウトすることについてはどうですか？ボタンをクリックしたときにメッセージを表示するアプリを構築してみましょう。最初の“Hello World”では、ボタンのラベルを<code>button.clicked.connect<\/code>を使ってどのように変更したかを覚えていますか？そのメソッドをもう一度使ってみましょう。ボタンのラベルを変更するだけでなく、空のラベルをメッセージに変更するために使用します。",
    "Let’s create a Window with a vertical Grid that contains a Button and a Label:": "Button と Label を含む垂直 Grid を持つ Window を作成しましょう。",
    "This time when we created our grid, we gave it another property: <code>row_spacing<\/code>. We can also add <code>column_spacing<\/code>, but since we’re stacking widgets vertically we’ll only see the effect of <code>row_spacing<\/code>. Notice how we can create new widgets outside the grid and then pack them into the grid by name. This is really helpful when you start using different methods to change the properties of your widgets.": "今回は、グリッドを作成したときに、別のプロパティ<code>row_spacing<\/code>を与えました。<code>column_spacing<\/code>を追加することもできますが、ウィジェットを垂直方向に積み重ねているので、<code>row_spacing<\/code>の効果だけが表示されます。グリッドの外に新しいウィジェットを作成してから、名前でグリッドにパックする方法に注目してください。これは、ウィジェットのプロパティを変更するために異なるメソッドを使い始めるときに非常に役立ちます。",
    "Now, let’s hook up the button to change that label. To keep our code logically separated, we’re going to add it below <code>window.add (grid);<\/code>. In this way, the first portion of our code defines the UI and the next portion defines the functions that we associated with the UI:": "",
    "Remember, we set the button as insensitive here because clicking it again has no effect. Now compile your app and marvel at your newfound skills. Play around with orientation and spacing until you feel comfortable.": "思い出してください、ここでボタンを反応しないように設定します。それをもう一回クリックすることには効果がないためです。今すぐあなたのアプリをコンパイルし、あなたの新しく見つけたスキルに驚嘆してください。あなたが納得するまで向きと間隔を入れて遊んでください。",
    "The Attach Method": "アタッチメソッド",
    "While we can use <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code> simply to create single row or single column layouts with the add method, we can also use it to create row-and-column-based layouts with the <code>attach<\/code> method. First we’re going to create a new <code>Gtk.Grid<\/code> and set both column and row spacing, then we’ll create all the widgets we want to attach to our grid, and finally we’ll attach them.": "addメソッドで単一行または単一列のレイアウトを作成するために<code>Gtk.Grid \n<\/code>をシンプルに使うこともできますが、<code>attach<\/code>メソッドで行と列をベースにしたレイアウトを作成するために使うこともできます。まず、新しい<code>Gtk.Grid<\/code>を作成し、列と行の間隔を設定してから、グリッドにアタッチしたいすべてのウィジェットを作成し、最後にそれらをアタッチします 。",
    "Make sure to give the Grid, Buttons, and Labels unique names that you’ll remember. It’s best practice to use descriptive names so that people who are unfamiliar with your code can understand what a widget is for without having to know your app inside and out.": "グリッド、ボタン、ラベルには、あなたが思い出せるような一意の名前をつけてください。コードに精通していない人がアプリケーションの内部と外部を知らなくてもウィジェットが何であるかを理解できるように、記述的な名前を使用することがベストプラクティスです。",
    "Notice that the attach method takes 5 arguments:": "attach メソッドは5つの引数を取ります。",
    "The widget that you want to attach to the grid.": "グリッドにアタッチしたいウィジェット。",
    "The column number to attach to starting at 0.": "0からはじまる、アタッチする列番号。",
    "The row number to attach to starting at 0.": "0からはじまる、アタッチする行番号。",
    "The number of columns the widget should span.": "ウィジェットがスパンする列の数。",
    "The number of rows the widget should span.": "ウィジェットがスパンする行の数。",
    "You can also use <code>attach_next_to<\/code> to place a widget next to another one on <a href=\"https:\/\/valadoc.org\/gtk+-3.0\/Gtk.PositionType\">all four sides<\/a>. Don’t forget to add the functionality associated with our buttons:": "",
    "You’ll notice in the example code above that we’ve created a 2 x 2 grid with buttons on the left and labels on the right. The top label goes from blank to “Hello World!” and the button label is rotated 90 degrees. Notice how we gave the buttons labels that directly call out what they do to the other labels.": "上記に示す例のコードでは、左にボタン、右にラベルがある2 x 2グリッドが作成されていることがわかります。一番上のラベルが、空白から \"Hello World!\" に変わり、ボタンのラベルが90度回転します。どのようにボタンラベルを付けたかに注目してください。",
